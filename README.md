# Multi-class-classification

We use the Iris dataset, which is a 3-class dataset in which 1 class is linearly separable from the others but the other are not linearly separable from each other. The classes correpond to different types of Iris plants while the 4 features represent the dimensions of the leaves. It is a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning. Ref:- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html
